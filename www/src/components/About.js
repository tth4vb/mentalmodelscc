    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Climate change is an overwhelming problem. It touches every person, every industry, every company, and every country. The causes, solutions, and implications are complex. It's no wonder that many of us find it easier to avoid or deny the problem.</p>
    <p>
      We can never hope to completely make sense of climate change, but that doesn't mean we can't try. The mission of Mental Models for Climate Change is to curate ideas and frameworks for making sense of climate change, with the hope that sharing
       and honing these ideas will help us approach the issue with clearer thinking, objectivity, and confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mental Models for Climate Change is curated by <a href="https://twitter.com/trevorhinkle3">Trevor Hinkle</a>, but is meant to be a collaborative effort. Everyone comes to this issue of climate change with their own unique perspective, and this project
      will be most successful if it can aggregate and amplify a diverse range of voices and perspectives.
